# phase-3-final-project

###  Welcome to the end of Phase 3! You've learned about a lot in this unit:

- Python fundamentals.
- Data structures (and more recently, algorithms).
- Object-oriented programming.
- Object inheritance.
- Class attributes and methods.
= Configuring applications.
- SQL fundamentals.
- Table relations in SQL.
- Object-relational mapping with Python.
- Object-relational mapping with SQLAlchemy.
- Building CLIs.
- In this project, we're going to use these skills to create a CLI. We want you to display knowledge of as much from Phase 3 as you can- you won't be able to fit everything in, but we'll expect to see:

- A CLI application that solves a real-world problem and adheres to best practices.
- A database created and modified with SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables.
- A well-maintained virtual environment using Pipenv.
- Proper package structure in your application.
- Use of lists, dicts, and tuples.
- Appropriate and accurate implementation of an algorithm from the Data Structures and Algorithms Canvas module.
- A rubric for this project is available on the next page in this Canvas module. Make sure to take a look before you get started!
## Problem Statement
- Many organizations need a reliable way to track the attendance of their employees or contractors. To address this problem, you can create a
  Time Tracking and Attendance System CLI application that enables users to sign in and out of work, recording timestamps for attendance records.
## Solution
-  The Time Tracking and Attendance System CLI is a software application designed to streamline and improve the process of tracking employee attendance, work hours, and overall productivity within an organization. The system offers a comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges faced by both employees
   and administrators, providing a user-friendly interface for efficient time management and attendance tracking.
## MVP Features
- 1- User Registration: Allow administrators to register users (employees or contractors) with details like name, employee ID, and role.
- 2- User Authentication: Implement user authentication to ensure only authorized users can sign in and out.
- 4- Attendance History: Provide a history of attendance records, including timestamps for sign-ins and sign-outs.
- 5-  Admin Controls: Allow administrators to manage user accounts, view attendance records, and generate reports for all users.

## Implementation
- 1- Identify the Problem  - I started by identifying a problem or need in my target domain or audience. In this case, the problem is tracking employee attendance and work hours accurately.
- 2-  Desktop  Research- Used online resources to gather information on best way to implement an attendance time tracker 
- 3-  User Persona-  Create user personas or profiles to understand the needs, pain points, and preferences of the potential users. In the case of attendance tracking, I considered both administrators and employees
- 4- Identify the technologies, tools, and frameworks that will be used to implement the project. Consider factors like scalability, data storage, and security.
